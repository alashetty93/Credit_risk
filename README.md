### Minimizing credit risk in Online Peer-to-peer lending markets  using Machine Learning
An alternative to traditional banking is the P2P lending system, which offers investors 
substantially larger returns and decent interest rates to borrowers with quicker access. 
However, it also carries greater risk than traditional banking institutions. Since these are 
unregulated markets, the study of the accounts involved in the system is crucial. The 
purpose of this research is to identify the different Machine Learning techniques to assess 
and forecast a borrower's creditworthiness and detect early warning signals for defaulters 
with the key factors contributing to it. The analysis will also focus on major challenges like 
imbalanced classification in P2P data and how it can be tackled using different techniques 
to avoid biased predictions.
